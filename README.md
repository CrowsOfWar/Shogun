SHOGUN: REBORN

Based off the novel by James Clavell (although it will not contain any of the characters
from the book), Shogun is a mod about Feudal Japan, and conquering the other lords to become
the most powerful. Or, of course, become the Shogunate. NPC interaction is a key aspect of
this mod, and the AI will be the most advanced EVER SEEN in Minecraft! (as far as I know)

Japan is a new dimension; you will need to find a way to get over there. These are naturally
generated structures. When entering Japan, you will have a role in society, determined by
how you got to Japan. For example, if you enter via ship, you may find yourself lying on
a sick-bed in a hospital... I wonder where I got THAAAT from...

Since these paragraphs are obviously taking a while, let me just give you a few bullet points
to get you up to speed. Heh heh, a "few".

 - Event system: after performing actions, they will be recorded in the player's internal
   log. This log contains all the actions the player took. Some NPCs may not know about certain
   events!
 
 - Awesome NPC interaction! Talk to NPCs, inspired by Mount&Blade. Of course, you don't really
   HAVE to be honest... so what's the problem with a ninja or two?
 
 - Super AI: NPCs each have their own long-term goals. For example, "conquer Blahblahblah" or
   "own large shop". Some NPCs may not have these goals because they couldn't realistically
   achieve them anyways, for example, eta villagers won't be dreaming of becoming the Shogun.
 
 - Honor level: Each NPC treats the player based on how honorable they think the player is.
   The calculated honor is based off of the social class and the actions the player previously
   took.
   
 - Daimyos; they are regional lords constantly fighting amongst each other due to the very loose
   rule of the Shogun. You can join under a Daimyo. Daimyos also rule land and villages around
   their castle. They have samurai which you may recieve if you get to a high rank.
   
 - Did I mention that you can become a daimyo yourself? I suppose one way of becoming one would be
   splitting away from your daimyo and achieving land, either as a gift or from war.
   
 - Generated villages & castles: I'm not really sure how this will work, but there will be castles
   and villages throughout the world for you to explore.
   
 - Units! Troops! War!! Lead your samurai into combat and issue complex-ish orders to them, like
   formations. Then of course you'll be able to win land from other daimyos.
 
 - Seppuku - You can be prompted to commit seppuku, for various reasons. Upon commiting suicide,
   your player data will be completely reset and you'll basically have to restart along the social
   hierarchy. Of course, you can decide not to commit seppuku, but your honor will suffer. Not
   to mention the other side effects, like becoming a ronin...
 
 - Amazing enchanting system! Instead of getting weird and crappy enchantments on your diamond
   swords, the items automatically get enchantments if they are used a lot. Durability is removed,
   so you can have a sword with history!
 
 - Armor, swords, stuff like that. They will be realistic looking too!
 
 - Priests that try to convert people to Christans
 
 - The Black Ship
 
 - Great trading, coupled with the amazing AI (which you should be hyping out about currently)
   you can buy/sell items to merchants, shopkeepers, restaurant owners, etc.
 
 - ONE DAY, there MIGHT be the possibility of pre-set world gen, that is, controlling the Japan dimension
   so it's actually an island. Similar to the LOTR mod.
 
 - Hire ninjas to assassinate people. But be careful! Hiring ninjas is dishonorable.

 - I might have forgotten some things, so don't worry! Your brain isn't done cramping with the intense
   information quite yet. Mwahahah.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This mod isn't meant to make you feel like you're IN Shogun the novel. It
simply is meant to recreate the experience in Shogun.
